# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Mi prueba de sistema operativo"

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.
PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Prueba de concepto para sistema operativo en x86_64 "

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.
RECURSIVE = YES

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.
GENERATE_LATEX = NO
